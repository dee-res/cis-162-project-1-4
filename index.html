<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I have some experience with HTML and CSS.
I also have some experience with WordPress and Shopify. I am currently trying to learn Javascript and Angular. I have found them to be challenging. Currently, I am taking courses on Coursera to get my IBM Full-Stack JavaScript Developer certificate. I was on the wait list for this class and I did not know I was enrolled so I missed the first class and quiz. I apologize for that. </p>

<h2>When I have free time</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Right now I do not have much free time with a 10 month old. She keeps me pretty busy.</li>
	<li>I try to catch up on my favorite tv shows when I can</li>
	<li>Pretty much showering or taking a quick nap</li>
</ol>

<p> One my of favorite websites is <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">W3 Schools</a> because I used it a lot when I first started coding.</p>
